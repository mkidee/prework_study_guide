# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    I wanted to create this website as a good warmup and refresher on how to code correctly, how to use commandline, and to learn new topics such as java. By doing this, it prepared me to start my full stack bootcamp. It helped me efficiently study and prepare for this 6 month journey. A lot of it was review for me- because I have a decent amount of knowledge in the field. But I had never done any work in java prior to this website. I also learned how similar java is to python, and I'll be able to use my knowledge in python to help me with java.

## Usage

This website will be used to review notes that I made about the basics of the coding languages that we touched up on. Additionally, we can see how functions work- being created and called- if we use the DevTools console. If we ever need to review basics, or if we want to add further notes on subjects as we learn, this is the place to return to!
